## Abstract

In order to properly understand and inform the community about the coming governance mechanisms on Cardano, we will test different voting scenarios of the Constitutional Committee. For these tests to be a success, 
we must have a small and very active set of Constitutional Committee members. Otherwise, it will not be possible for us to gather all the possible scenarios outcomes in a short period of time before the release of these features on the mainnet.
* We will use [ABLE pool's Sancho-testnet](https://discord.gg/tHYrxCtdHm) discussion channel as our main communication media to request votes on these specific governance actions.
* We will then inform you of the results by including them in this document, as well as the time (in Epochs) and manner (`Yes`, `No`, `Abstain`) that we will be doing those test.
* When all the votes of the members of the Constitutional Committee will be included in the ledger we will be able to compare the results against our expectations.
* Then, I will be able to trigger the results of the scenarios using a DReps that has over 51% of the total voting stakes to cross the DRep Threshold on its own.
* We already used that power to lower the Stake Pools Thresholds to 1% in order to facilitate our testings by allowing a single stake pool to cross the threshold on its own.

The most crucial aspect of these test scenarios is therefore the real power of the `Yes`, `No`, `Abstain` vote on the ratification of a governance action by the Consitutional Committee.

# Summary of the SanchoNet "Coup d'Ã‰tat"
We firmly wanted to be able to test all the voting possibilities as efficiently as possible. So we submitted a no-confidence governance action on the former Committee using our Drep of 2.7 millions voting power and the vote of the ABLE stake pool to cross the two necessary threshold in order to have it ratified. This subsequently allowed us to self-elect [Mike Hornan](https://github.com/Hornan7), [Johnny Kelly](https://github.com/intertreeJK) and [Nicolas Cerny](https://github.com/thenic95) as a new constitutional committee.

> **Note**
> The IOG developers who are currently working on governance mechanisms were aware of the situation and participated in the workshops and conversations about this takeover.

## The original Constitutional Committee
The former committee was composed of 9 members in total.
- Mike Hornan (ABLE)
- Johnny Kelly
- Mladen (RUMOR)
- SMAUG
- Martin (ATADA)
- Jonah
- Nicolas Lovecoach
- Adam Rusch
- Rick McCracken (DIGI)

## The new temporary Constitutional Committee
The new committee is made up of three active members, each with three cold key pairs. All the information about the governance actions that allowed us to temporarily gain control can be found below.

# Constitutional Committee voting tests and outcomes
Here are the Constitutional hot keys hashes that we have authorized for our tests. 
Each key hash will be assigned a key identifier in order to vote according to the configuration of our tests set up by Johnny Kelly.

## First test suite
The Goal of the test is to determine all final Proposal Ratification outcomes of all combinations of Yes/No votes from Constitutional Committee Members, not accounting for explicit Abstain Votes.

## Second test suite
The Goal of the test is to determine all final Proposal Ratification outcomes of various **important** combinations of Yes Votes and Abstain Positions from Constitutional Committee Members.
### Expected Results

**Suite 2:**

| Test no. | Vote pattern  | Expected result   |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
Test 1     | 1 Yes, 1 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met
Test 2     | 1 Yes, 2 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met
Test 3     | 1 Yes, 3 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met
Test 4     | 1 Yes, 4 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met
Test 5     | 1 Yes, 5 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met 
Test 6     | 1 Yes, 6 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 7     | 1 Yes, 7 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 8     | 1 Yes, 8 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 9     | 2 Yes, 1 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met 
Test 10    | 2 Yes, 2 Abstain   | No Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, not being met 
Test 11    | 2 Yes, 3 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 12    | 2 Yes, 4 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 13    | 2 Yes, 5 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 14    | 2 Yes, 6 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 15    | 2 Yes, 7 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes
Test 16    | 3 Yes, 1 Abstain   | Confirmed Ratifcation due to revised Quorum requirement, caused by explicit Abstain Positions, being met and more than 51% voting Yes

NB: Testing ends here as 3 Yes votes alone should pass the original full 9 CC Member Quorum requirements of 3 of 9 even with **any** variation of Abstain Positions accompanying. Same applies for any amount of Yes Votes by CC Members **above** 3 total.
